# Tools to make note-taking easier.

## What is that?

I take notes using vim and like to keep things organized. So I enjoy having directories for each subject. I write with vim, and use `pandoc` to render notes into nice pdfs. But that requires little scripts, and they're not fun to write each and every time a new class begins ðŸ˜¢.

So I've created a little script to ease things a little.

## How to use it?

Here's how it works:

`./school_dir new_year` will create a directory `new_year` in which all classes will be stored.

Once in that directory, simply type `./newdir class_1 class_2 class_3` and your classes 1, 2 and 3 will be initialized.

When following a course in class 1, go in that directory and type `../newfile`. This creates a new markdown file for you to write in. Its name is the date. When finished, type `../run_last` to run pandoc and get your nice pdf. Once class is over, type `../orga`. This puts all markdown files in `source`, and all pdfs in `output`. So your notes are great looking and easy to access.

## Required setup

This shell script is written for macs (zsh). So for different shells, change `#!/bin/zsh` to your shell.
## Remarks

The `header-includes.txt` file is for packages and command in `TeX`. To add new packages or commands, add new lines.

`info.txt` and `language.txt` allow for customization (language of the class, teacher name, class name...)

## Structure

Here is an example. Typing

```bash
./school_dir Example
cd Example && ./newdir Dir1 Dir2 Dir3
cd Dir1
../newfile
../run_last && ../orga
```

Will result in:

```bash
Example
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dir1
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ info.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ language.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ output
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 04_02.pdf
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ source
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ 04_02.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Dir2
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ info.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ language.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ output
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ source
â”œâ”€â”€ Dir3
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ info.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ language.txt
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ output
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ source
â”œâ”€â”€ header-includes.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ lookfor
â”œâ”€â”€ newdir
â”œâ”€â”€ newfile
â”œâ”€â”€ nice_date.py
â”œâ”€â”€ orga
â””â”€â”€ run_last
```

### Looking for something

In a given directory,

```bash
../lookup these words
```

Will open the pdfs containing "these words".
